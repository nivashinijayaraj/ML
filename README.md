## About Lazy predict


Lazy predict is an awesome Python library that helps you quickly build machine learning models at scale and choose the best suitable model.


Actually,If you are working in the field of Machine Learning or Data science then you are definitely at the right place. Selecting the best model for your Machine Learning problem statement is one of the difficult tasks.

First, you have to import all the libraries then tune the parameters, then compare all the models, then check the model performance using different objectives. This process takes a lot of time. To avoid this problem, Lazy Predict comes into the picture.
